I'll create a comprehensive TODO file with all the implementation details for the sidebar width control system.

Task 2: Create SidebarLayout Component
File: src/components/ui/SidebarLayout.tsx (NEW FILE)

Purpose: Reusable layout component for all sidebar pages with proper width control

Code to implement:

Task 3: Update UI Index File
File: index.ts (MODIFY)

Action: Add exports for new components

Add these lines:

Phase 2: Update Critical Pages (Priority: HIGH)
Task 4: Fix HostSettings Page (CRITICAL - Currently Broken)
File: HostSettings.tsx (MODIFY)

Current Problem: Content spilling to right edge
Solution: Wrap entire content in SidebarSettingsLayout

Instructions for LLM:

Import SidebarSettingsLayout from ../../ui
Find the outermost container div (usually with className containing background/min-h-screen)
Replace that container with <SidebarSettingsLayout> wrapper
Remove any max-w-*, mx-auto, p-* classes from the original container
Keep all existing content and functionality unchanged
Ensure NavigationHeader and tabs remain properly styled
Expected structure after change:

Task 5: Fix SessionSummary Page
File: SessionSummary.tsx (MODIFY)

Instructions for LLM:

Import SidebarCompactLayout from ../../ui
Wrap entire content in SidebarCompactLayout
Remove container padding/width classes
Keep NavigationHeader and all existing functionality
Task 6: Fix HostSetup Page
File: HostSetup.tsx (MODIFY)

Instructions for LLM:

Import SidebarCompactLayout from ../../ui
Wrap content in SidebarCompactLayout
Remove any width constraint classes from main container
Task 7: Fix HostActive Page
File: HostActive.tsx (MODIFY)

Instructions for LLM:

Import SidebarCompactLayout from ../../ui
Wrap content in SidebarCompactLayout
Ensure real-time content updates still work properly
Phase 3: Update Remaining Pages (Priority: MEDIUM)
Task 8: Fix WelcomeScreen
File: WelcomeScreen.tsx (MODIFY)

Instructions: Use SidebarCompactLayout, maintain existing CTA layout

Task 9: Fix FreeTrialActivatedScreen
File: FreeTrialActivatedScreen.tsx (MODIFY)

Instructions: Use SidebarCompactLayout

Phase 4: Modal and Component Updates (Priority: MEDIUM)
Task 10: Update Modal Positioning
Files: All modal components in modals

Instructions for LLM:

Find modal container elements
Ensure they have max-w-md or appropriate max-width
Add mx-auto for centering
Ensure modals don't exceed sidebar width with: style={{ maxWidth: 'calc(100vw - 2rem)' }}
Task 11: Update Card Components (if needed)
File: Card.tsx (VERIFY)

Check: Ensure Card component doesn't have conflicting width styles

Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Priority: HIGH)
Task 12: Create Test Checklist
Manual Testing Required:

 HostSettings page no longer spills to right edge
 Content expands leftward when sidebar is narrow
 All pages maintain proper right-edge alignment
 NavigationHeader components still function properly
 Modals don't exceed sidebar width
 Responsive behavior works at different window sizes
 Dark mode styling remains intact
 All existing functionality preserved
Test at these sidebar widths:

 350px (narrow mobile)
 400px (standard Zoom sidebar)
 480px (wide Zoom sidebar)
 600px+ (very wide sidebar)
Task 13: Accessibility Validation
 All content remains keyboard accessible
 Focus indicators remain visible
 Screen reader navigation unaffected
 Touch targets maintain 44px minimum
Implementation Notes for LLM
Key Principles:
Right-edge fixed: Content should align to right edge of sidebar, never spill over
Expand leftward: When content needs more space, it grows left, not right
Preserve functionality: All existing features, handlers, and styling must remain intact
Progressive enhancement: New layout system should enhance, not replace existing functionality
Common Patterns to Replace:
WRONG (causes spillover):

CORRECT (right-aligned, expands left):

WRONG (centers and can spill):

CORRECT (sidebar-aware):

Debugging Tips:
If content still spills: check for nested containers with mx-auto
If content is too narrow: increase maxWidth prop or use maxWidth="auto"
If spacing looks wrong: adjust padding prop ('sm', 'md', 'lg')
Error Prevention:
Always preserve existing imports and exports
Keep all event handlers and state management unchanged
Don't remove TypeScript types or interfaces
Maintain existing component prop interfaces
Success Criteria
✅ Primary Goal: Settings page no longer spills to right edge
✅ Secondary Goal: All sidebar pages have consistent width behavior
✅ Tertiary Goal: Responsive behavior for different sidebar widths
✅ Quality Goal: Zero regression in existing functionality

Rollback Plan
If implementation causes issues:

Remove SidebarLayout imports from all files
Restore original container classes
Delete new files: useSidebarWidth.ts and SidebarLayout.tsx
Update ui/index.ts to remove new exports
Estimated Timeline
Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure): 2-3 hours
Phase 2 (Critical Pages): 2-3 hours
Phase 3 (Remaining Pages): 1-2 hours
Phase 4 (Modals): 1 hour
Phase 5 (Testing): 2-3 hours
Total: 8-12 hours
Status: Ready for implementation
